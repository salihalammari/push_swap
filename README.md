Push_Swap Tutorial

Push_swap is an algorithm project at school 42. I’ll introduce this project briefly and share an algorithm to solve it : radix sort.
Advantages of this algorithm : easy to implement, stable
Disadvantages of this algorithm : passable but won’t get full score (unless you can find a way to optimize it)

Introduction:

First, we start with two stacks called A and B.

A is filled with some random integers (without duplicate) and B is empty. We can perform certain instructions on these stacks, and the goal is to sort all these integers with the least instructions possible.
If the original stacks look like this
